# crashbot
A test bot used to identify potential crash strategies.

For this to work properly, selenium and a chrome webdriver will need to be installed. Not included in a venv since it was the only install.

DataBot just needs to be opened and it will navigate to the crash website and start recording data (Unless the website xcode for the results has changed). GameBot needs to be opened in interactive mode and GameBot.runChanceOfDouble() needs to be executed.

The parameter values can be changed within the runChanceOfDouble() function.
